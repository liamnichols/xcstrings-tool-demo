# Dog Tracker

A demo project using [xcstrings-tool](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool).

## Overview

Dog Tracker is a small iOS application localized using Xcode 15's new Strings Catalog (xcstrings) format. Instead of using the Swift Compiler to discover localized strings in the source code and to insert them into the Strings Catalog, the project uses the build tool plugin provided by [xcstrings-tool](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool) to generate constant definitions.
